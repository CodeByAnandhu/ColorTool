ðŸŽ¨ Excited to introduce my latest project: a Color Picker website Named Color Tool, powered by React.js and Vite! ðŸŒˆ

This innovative tool allows you to:
ðŸ”¹ Pick colors directly from your uploaded images
ðŸ”¹ Receive suggested color palettes based on the 60/30/10 rule
ðŸ”¹ Explore and customize color combinations effortlessly

With a focus on usability and creativity, this project showcases my passion for frontend development and UI/UX design.
